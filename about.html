      <p>OUR AIM</p>
      <h2>The ultimate goal of a gym is to help make its members healthier. Some health clubs require that new members undergo a health assessment. You will be weighed and a staff member will measure your body fat composition. These tests should not replace a proper wellness examination from your doctor. You should also consult your doctor before joining a health club,
         particularly if you are new to exercise.Right now, you might be hitting the gym pretty hard, getting yourself into the best shape of your life. Of course, it won’t always be that way, so just realize that fitness should be a part of your life for decades to come. A number of athletes refuse to ease off the gas pedal, going all out and then quitting exercise cold turkey. Obviously, there are others who never take up healthy exercise habits in the first place. “I have seen too many extremely successful people pass away in their early 50s because they never took care of themselves,” says trainer Mike Duffy, who owns his own personal training company in New Jersey. “They end up leaving their beautiful children, wonderful wives and the enjoyment of their financial success because nutrition and fitness were never incorporated into their lifestyles.”
          Realize that fitness should be a lifetime commitment with ever-changing goals and expectations, and it should help you live a longer, healthier life.</h2>
